This repository contains the statistical analyses conducted for the study "*Dealing with idioms: An eye-tracking study of cognitive  processing on native speakers, L2 and heritage speakers of  Spanish*".

To ensure the successful execution of the scripts, a specific folder structure is required. The raw data should be stored in `0_data/1_raw_data`. The data preparation is carried out by running `description.R` first. Once the data has been preprocessed, the main statistical analysis can be performed using `analysis.R`.
